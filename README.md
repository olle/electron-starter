# Electron Starter #

This starter-kit, aims to provide example setups, or templates, for
[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) applications, running with
embedded backends, of different types (not just NodeJS).

## Getting started ##

Requires `node` and `npm`. Install dependencies and start the application by
running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

_Proof of Concept: The current version provides the most simple Spring-Boot
                   based JAR-application there is ("Hello World!") and simply
                   shows how a small splash-screen/loader can transition into
                   the Java-App. The idea is to extend this in the future, with
                   starters for some popular development stacks. Have fun!_
